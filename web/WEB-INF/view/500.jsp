                    <p>Operator, well could you help me place this call? </br>
                        See, the number on the matchbook is old and faded </br>
                        She's living in L.A. with my best old ex-friend Ray </br>
                        A guy she said she knew well and sometimes hated </br>
                        Isn't that the way they say it goes? Well, let's forget all that </br>
                        And give me the number if you can find it </br>
                        So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine and to show </br>
                        I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well </br>
                        I only wish my words could just convince myself </br>
                        That it just wasn't real, but that's not the way it feels </br>
                        Operator, well could you help me place this call? </br>
                        Well, I can't read the number that you just gave me </br>
                        There's something in my eyes, you know it happens every time </br>
                        I think about a love that I thought would save me </br>
                        Isn't that the way they say it goes? Well, let's forget all that </br>
                        And give me the number if you can find it </br>

                        That it just wasn't real, but that's not the way it feels </br>
                        No, no, no, no - that's not the way it feels </br>
                        Operator, well let's forget about this call </br>
                        There's no one there I really wanted to talk to </br>
                        Thank you for your time, ah, you've been so much more than kind </br>
                        And you can keep the dime </br>
                        Isn't that the way they say it goes? Well, let's forget all that </br>
